# SAM
SAM stands for Social and Algorithmic Machine Learning. SAM functions as a chatbot and uses user-oriented learning to identify unknown user inputs and store data on how it should respond. SAM operates as a social experiment; will people use it legitimately to train the AI, or will they input irrelevant information or jokes? Currently, SAM is in its beta phase and has not yet been released to the public at full scale. Contribute to the experiment at https://replit.com/@Jxcob-VFX/SAM?v=1
